# Notes-09 CLoud Architecture 

## AWS Well-Architected Framework

**“Cloud architects engage with decision makers to identify the business goal and the capabilities that need improvement. They ensure alignment between technology deliverables of a solution and the business goals. They work with delivery teams that are implementing the solution to ensure that the technology features are appropriate.”**

•	A guide designed to help build the most secure, high performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure possible

•	Provides set of foundational questions and practices that help implement user cloud architectures 

•	Fiver pillar organization: 

    o	Operational excellence

    o	Security 

    o	Reliability 

    o	Performance efficiency 

    o	Cost optimization 

## Operational Excellence Pillar

•	Focuses on ability to run & monitor systems to improve operations and deliver business value

•	Six principles of operation: 

    o	Perform operations as code 

    o	Annotate documentation 

    o	Frequent, small, revisable changes 

    o	Refine operations procedures 

    o	Anticipate failure 

    o	Learn from all operational events and failures

•	Operational excellence questions fall under prepare, operate, and evolve 

## Security Pillar 

•	Focuses on the ability to protect info, systems, and assets 

•	Key areas are confidentiality, integrity of data, identifying, privilege management, as well as protecting systems and 
establishing control to detect security events 

•	Seven design principles for security 
  
    o	Strong identity foundation 

    o	Enable traceability 

    o	Security at all layers 

    o	Automate security best practices 

    o	Protect data in transit and at rest 

    o	Keep people away from data 

    o	Prepare for security events 

Reliability Pillar 

•	Focuses on ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, meeting computing resource demand, mitigate disruptions

•	Reliability principles: 

    o	Test recovery procedures 

    o	Auto recover from failure 

    o	Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability 

    o	Stop guessing capacity 

    o	Manage change in automation 

•	Reliability question consist around foundations, change management, and failure management

Performance Efficiency Pillar 

•	Focuses on ability to use IT and computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements 

•	Performance Efficiency principles 

    o	Democratize advanced technologies 

    o	Go global in minutes 

    o	Use serverless architectures 

    o	Experiment often 

    o	Mechanical Sympathy 

•	Performance efficiency questions include selection, review, monitoring, and tradeoffs

Cost Optimization Pillar

•	Focuses on ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point 

•	Understanding & controlling money being spent 

•	Selecting right number of resource types and analyzing over time 

•	Scaling to meet business needs while being cost efficient 

•	Cost optimization design principles 

    o	Adopt a consumption model 

    o	Measure overall efficiency 

    o	Stop spending money on data center operations 

    o	Analyze expenditure 

    o	Use managed and application-level services reducing cost of ownership 

**“One of the best practices identified in the AWS Well-Architected Framework is to plan for failure, which means application or workload downtime. You need to architect your applications and workloads to withstand failure.”**
